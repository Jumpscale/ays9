# AYS Portal

AYS services and templates are visualized in the **AYS Portal**.

Using the portal it is possible to view the repositories and templates in the system. It is possible to navigate to AYS repos and perform various actions such as executing blueprints, editing blueprints, viewing the runs and the service instances created.

The portal is installed when using the `-p` option during the building of js9(see [js9 installation](https://github.com/Jumpscale/developer/blob/master/README.md)).

For more information about the portal check the docs at [portal](https://github.com/Jumpscale/portal9/tree/master/docs/AYS/walkthrough)
