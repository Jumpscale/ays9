# Getting Started

You will most probably want to start on your local machine, by creating a Docker container with AYS pre-configured as documented in [Create a JS9 Docker container](js9.md).

Next you will want to start AYS in your container as documented in [Start AYS](startays.md), allowing you to interact with AYS from the command line.

Optionally you might want to join your ZeroTier network, documented in [Join Your ZeroTier Network](zt.md), this will allow you to interact with AYS via its RESTful API.

In order to interact with AYS through the Python client you need to install the Python client on the remote machine, documented in [Install the Python client](python.md).

You can also interact with AYS through the AYS Portal, once you have the Portal installed and started as documented in [Start the AYS Portal](portal.md).
