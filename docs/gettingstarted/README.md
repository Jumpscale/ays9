# Getting Started

First you will want to prepare your environment:

- You will most probably want to start on your local machine, by creating a Docker container with AYS pre-configured as documented in [Create a JS9 Docker container](js9.md)
- Once the container runs, you will want to review the [AYS Configuration](configuration.md) and start the AYS server as documented in [Start AYS](startays.md), allowing you to interact with AYS from the command line
- Optionally you might want to join your ZeroTier network, documented in [Join Your ZeroTier Network](zt.md), this will allow you to interact with AYS via its RESTful API from clients connected to your ZeroTier network
- In order to interact with AYS through the Python client you need to install the Python client on the remote machine, documented in [Install the Python client](python.md)
- You can also interact with AYS through the AYS Portal, once you have the Portal installed and started as documented in [Start the AYS Portal](portal.md)

Once all that is done, we recommend to go through the How To's:
- [How to Create a New Repository](../Howto/Create_repository/README.md)
- [How to Create a VDC](../Howto/Create_VDC/README.md)

Or checkout the [Walkthroughs](../walkthroughs/README.md):
- [Create an Actor Template](../walkthroughs/Create_actor_template.md)
- [Deploy Zero-OS on Packet.net](../walkthroughs/Deploy_Zero-OS.md)
